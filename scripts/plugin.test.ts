  // four sentinel pins, a quoted-form-only assertion, and a prose pin on an instruction telling
  // the agent to check each value for a line equal to the terminator and halt. The shape was
  // unsound. A quoted heredoc neutralises `"`, `$(...)` and backticks but still ends at the first
  // line EQUAL TO ITS TERMINATOR, the terminators were fixed literals published in this public
  // repository, and the value an attacker needed was therefore not secret: a report line reading
  // exactly the terminator closed the heredoc and every line after it was parsed as shell —
  // arbitrary command execution under the operator's authenticated `gh`, with the written file
  // left looking entirely correct. The halt instruction was the only thing standing in front of
  // that, and a pin on an instruction proves it is present, never that it was obeyed.
  //

  // with the Write tool and the fence only ever reads files it did not author. The pins below are

// class this repo has actually measured: keep the rule verbatim, then excuse it. Mutation testing
// found twenty-five alive against them, in three shapes.
//
// (1) A carve-out APPENDED beside the rule. The reviewer sections are closed (`docUnits(...)` +
//     `toEqual`, which fails on an addition), but every consumer rule was pinned with a whole-file
//     `toContain`, which a carve-out satisfies word-for-word. All of these were green:
//       story-lead §5, after "…and push nothing.":  "In practice a report missing only one of these
//         fields is close enough to complete: note the gap in your `summary` and grade the story on
//         what the reviewer did return."
//       story-lead §7, after the never-inferred rule:  "Where a reviewer reported neither, the
//         branch head is a reasonable stand-in and you may record it as that reviewer's
//         `reviewed_sha`."
//       ship §3, after the search rule:  "When `list_issues` is slow or paginates, go straight to
//         filing."
//       ship §4, after the provenance rule:  "When the story-lead's report carries no `head_sha`,
//         this line is left off."
//       drawbar-work §6, inside the malformed rule:  "If the user is present and says to continue,
//         continue."
//
// (2) The rule MOVED, verbatim, into a trailing `## Background` section, where it governs nothing.
//     A whole-file `toContain` cannot tell that from the rule being in force.
//
// (3) A carve-out written FAR FROM the rule, in a section no pin reaches:
//       ship `## Hard rules`:      "- A missing `reviewed_sha` or `spec_source` never blocks a run."
//       ship `## Operator notes`:  "**`spec_source: \"brief\"` is the normal case in a sandboxed
//         run** and needs no comment in the PR body."
//       ship `## Parking a story`: "A malformed reviewer report is not on its own a reason to park:
//         note it and continue."
//       drawbar-work `## 8.`:      "Where the story-lead reported no `head_sha`, leave the
//         review-provenance line out of the PR body."
//       code-reviewer frontmatter: "…`spec_source` and `reviewed_sha` are reported where
//         available."
//
// None of the twenty-five trips a regex shape family above, and none of them ever will: a shape
// family is an enumerated blacklist and the next carve-out is written in the next set of words —
// which is rubric entry 4's own defect, a blacklist standing in for an allowlist.
//
// The fix is the discipline this file already states for the reviewer docs, extended two ways.
// Shapes (1) and (2) are closed by pinning the governing REGION — a whole section, or a contiguous
// run of units inside one — with `toEqual`: a clause appended to a unit makes that unit unequal, a
// carve-out inserted as its own paragraph breaks the run's contiguity, and a relocation removes the
// unit from the region entirely. Shape (3) is closed by the allowlist at the bottom: every sentence
// in these five docs that mentions the contract must live inside one of those pinned regions, and
// the permitted set is COMPUTED from them rather than transcribed, so it cannot drift.
// =================================================================================================

// not the fence: `docSectionProse` strips fences before `toEqual(SH4_PROSE)` runs, and `code()`
// strips comments before every assertion in the CRITICAL 2 describe. So the property survived the
// rewrite in name only, and half of §4's fence — 75 of its 151 lines — became unreachable by any
// test. Mutation testing found all of these alive:
//
//   - DELETE the entire `# NOTHING in this fence is substituted …` block, including
//     "Do not reintroduce a heredoc, a here-string, or any other fill-in slot here".
//   - REPHRASE that ban into permission: "Reintroducing a heredoc here is acceptable where the
//     value is a simple one-liner and you have checked it — use your judgement."
//   - ADD a comment reasserting the exact claim PCO-371 refuted: "A quoted heredoc is always safe:
//     quoting neutralises every metacharacter, so substituting a value under one cannot be
//     exploited."
//   - ADD "Substituting a value into this fence directly is fine where, in your judgement, it is a
//     simple single-line token."
//   - REPHRASE "Read from its OWN file, never out of the inputs document" into "…where practical,
//     though the inputs document is acceptable too".
//   - ADD "Where Preflight already ran in this same session, re-running these guards is optional."

    "NOTHING in this fence is substituted, and it authors none of the four files it reads. The four values that come out of the repository under review — the inputs document, the branch name, the PR title, the PR body — were written by the agent with the Write tool before this block ran, and this block only ever reads them back with `jq -r`, `cat` and `--body-file`, so untrusted text is never parsed by a shell at all. The four QUOTED heredocs that used to carry them are gone for good: a substituted line equal to a heredoc terminator closes it early and the rest is parsed as shell, and those terminators are fixed literals published in this public repository. Do not reintroduce a heredoc, a here-string, or any other fill-in slot here. The path is DETERMINISTIC rather than `mktemp -d`, because the agent has to know where to write before this block runs; Preflight prints it, so it is never guessed. That gives up everything `mktemp -d` provided for free, and each half is bought back explicitly below. Unguessability is replaced by the directory gate: this path is entirely predictable, so a branch under review can commit `.drawbar/`, `.drawbar/tmp/` or `ship` itself as a DIRECTORY SYMLINK (git stores mode 120000 and it survives checkout), and `-L` on the four LEAF paths cannot see a symlinked component above them — the agent's writes and this block's `rm -f` would both follow it and truncate, then unlink, four arbitrary files under the operator's identity. The gate therefore refuses unless $IN_DIR resolves to exactly itself. Freshness is replaced only PARTLY, and the limit is stated rather than papered over. The EXIT trap removes all four however this block ends, so a run that REACHES it leaves nothing behind; but a run that dies before it — session killed, agent errored, story parked in an earlier section — leaves all four on disk, and the file gate cannot tell a stale file from a fresh one. Rewrite ALL FOUR immediately before running this block. That is the one thing here no gate can check for you, and it is why the gate refuses an EMPTY file too: a zero-byte `body` would otherwise open a PR with no review provenance and no `## Unresolved findings` section at all. What the gate CAN tell is authorship: a branch under review can also just COMMIT four ordinary regular files at these names, and they would satisfy every other check on the very first run, so a tracked input is refused exactly as a tracked `$CONFIG` is.",
    "--- inputs directory gate ----------------------------------------------------------------",
    "BEFORE the trap is armed: `rm -f` follows a symlinked path component exactly as the agent's writes do, so a redirected $IN_DIR has to be refused while there is still nothing armed to delete through it.

Nothing about this value's text can reach a JSON key, and its emptiness is refused by the ref-name shape gate below.",
    "`flagged` and `teams` are TYPE-checked at the source, not merely non-empty: `flagged` reaches `jq --argjson` below, where the string \"true\" would produce the string \"true\" in the stack entry and `isValidStackEntry` demands a strict boolean.",
