// F8/S8 (PCO-353): the step 6 ("## 6. Capture and sync knowledge") sync loop, extracted whole
// out of `commands/drawbar-ship.md`'s bash fence and put behind tests, same house style as
// `scripts/lib/ship-config.ts`:
//
//   - `syncKnowledge` — the tolerant retry loop: stage, commit-if-staged, assert a clean
//     precondition, rebase, push, and (only on a genuine push REJECTION) retry. Halts
//     non-zero, with a distinct reason, on everything else — including exhaustion, which is
//     the exact F8 regression this module exists to close (the old bash's `break` fired only
//     on success, so total failure was silently indistinguishable from a clean sync).
//   - `knowledgePreflight` — Locked 16's three assertions on the KNOWLEDGE repo (not the
//     project repo Preflight already checked): dirty-tree, `merge=union` on both KB files,
//     and an assert-or-create of `.drawbar/runs/.gitignore`.
//   - `assertEnvDirTrusted` — the trust root BOTH of the above apply to `envDir` before their
//     first git call. See its own comment block below; it is the R5/F2 fix.
//
// --- what R5 changed (PCO-368), in one place ------------------------------------------------
//
// Four behaviours of the per-attempt sequence were wrong in ways the fake runner could not see,
// because the fake modelled neither the filesystem nor git's pathspec semantics:
//
//   F1  `git add` on a GITIGNORED path exits 1, and the loop called that `add_failed` and
//       halted. Wherever `knowledge.archive.jsonl` is gitignored, the first supersede created
//       the file and every subsequent sync halted PERMANENTLY. Both knowledge paths are now
//       filtered through `git check-ignore` first.
//   F5  `git add` on a MISSING path exits 128. The archive had an existence guard; the active
//       file did not, so a scaffolded knowledge repo with no `knowledge.jsonl` and an empty
//       `lessons[]` halted on its first sync. Both paths are filtered, and when NEITHER
//       survives, stage+commit are skipped rather than attempted.
//   F6  `git diff --cached --quiet` and `git commit -m` carried NO pathspec. With an unrelated
//       file staged by someone else the diff exited 1, the commit swept that file in, the
//       dirty precondition then saw a clean tree, and the sweep was pushed. Both calls are now
//       scoped to exactly the paths this attempt staged.
//   F4  `knowledgePreflight`'s assert-or-create dropped its `writeFileSync` failure on the
//       floor — on a real first run with `.drawbar/runs/` absent it threw ENOENT straight past
//       `PreflightResult`. The mkdir/write pair is wrapped and reports a named reason.
//
// Every git exit code relied on above was VERIFIED by running real git 2.43.0, not assumed; the
// call sites carry the observed results and the reasoning about the ambiguous cases.
//
// --- what R7 changed (PCO-371), in one place ------------------------------------------------
//
// R5's trust root was a TAUTOLOGY and the ACE sink stayed open; three other paths from the same
// mutable state were unguarded or under-reported. All four were reproduced before being fixed:
//
//   T1  `--config-path` was an arbitrary shape-clean path, so a caller supplied BOTH sides of the
//       envDir equality (write a config naming your own directory, name it as your own trust
//       root). Now the config must resolve to the path THIS PROCESS's `$DRAWBAR_SHIP_CONFIG`/cwd
//       already point at, AND must not be tracked by git. See `assertEnvDirTrusted`.
//   T2  `--dir` (kbDir) had no trust root at all — a write sink (`mkdir -p` + append) and the
//       source of every git pathspec. Now required to be INSIDE the vouched-for `envDir`, checked
//       before `appendEntry` runs. See `isInsideDir`.
//   T3  R5/F1's "skip an ignored path, do not halt" turned a gitignored `knowledge.jsonl` into
//       permanent SILENT data loss (`{ok:true, staged:[]}` forever). `knowledgePreflight` now
//       refuses it outright, and a successful sync reports `ignored[]` with a loud stderr warning.
//   T4  Refusal JSON reached STDOUT unsanitized (`JSON.stringify` escapes no invisible/bidi
//       character), while stderr was sanitized. Both are sanitized now.
//
// R7 also corrected two comments that asserted things that were not true: the mid-merge/mid-rebase
// partial-commit case at the commit call site, and the "cannot skip it" claim at the CLI entry
// point.
//
// `commands/drawbar-ship.md` §6 (and its Preflight section) delegate WHOLE to this module's
// CLI — there is no second, hand-copied bash implementation of any of the checks below
// (single-implementation-site regression discipline; see scripts/plugin.test.ts).
//
// --- why inline KB writes stay, and the sync becomes tolerant instead (Locked 15) ---------
//
// The story-lead and implementer write KB entries INLINE, mid-run, via `drawbar-kb add`. That
// means the knowledge repo's working tree is dirty at unpredictable times — not a bug, the
// whole point of writing lessons down as you hit them rather than batching them for later.
// The old bash treated ANY dirtiness as fatal to the rebase and never re-staged inside its
// retry loop, so a mid-run inline write landed AFTER the one `git add` at the top was
// invisible to every retry. This module re-stages on EVERY attempt (see `syncKnowledge`'s
// per-attempt order) specifically so a mid-run write is picked up by a later attempt, and
// treats the untracked-file case as never-dirty (`--untracked-files=no`) so a lesson written
// to disk but not yet staged by drawbar-kb doesn't itself trip the precondition.
//
// --- `merge=union`, a concurrent supersede, and why the sync does NOT halt on it -----------
//
// `.gitattributes` sets `merge=union` on both `knowledge.jsonl` and `knowledge.archive.jsonl`
// — a rebase/merge on either file CONCATENATES both sides rather than raising a textual
// conflict, which is what lets this loop resolve a routine two-sided APPEND (the overwhelmingly
// common case: two different agents each append a new line) with no human in the loop.
//
// `store.ts`'s `appendEntry`, though, does NOT always append — a correction to an existing
// key's knowledge (any field but `ts` differing) SUPERSEDES: it rewrites `knowledge.jsonl` IN
// FULL (`writeActiveAtomic`) and appends the prior copy to `knowledge.archive.jsonl`. A full
// rewrite is not an append, and `merge=union` has no concept of "this same line changed on both
// sides" — it just keeps BOTH versions, active and superseded, rather than erroring. So a
// supersede that races a concurrent supersede of the SAME key on the other side of a pull
// produces a knowledge.jsonl carrying the key twICE (both versions, not a conflict) rather than
// a rebase failure.
//
// DECIDED: detect this and REPORT it, never halt on it. Turning a benign, self-inflicted union
// artifact into a night-ending halt is precisely the failure mode Locked 16's `check-attr`
// assertion (asserting union is actually configured, so a concurrent append genuinely does
// self-resolve rather than raising a real conflict this loop has no strategy for) exists to
// prevent. `syncKnowledge` counts duplicate keys in the ACTIVE store after a successful push
// and reports the count on stdout (`duplicateKeys`) plus a loud stderr warning naming an
// ATTENDED `drawbar-kb compact` run as the remedy — union is still the right choice for the
// append-dominated normal case; compact is what an operator runs by hand, occasionally, to
// clean up the rare collided-supersede case.
//
// --- never `archive`/`compact` in the loop --------------------------------------------------
//
// `drawbar-kb recall` searches ACTIVE entries only, so anything moved to the archive vanishes
// from every future recall silently — no error, no warning, just knowledge that stops existing
// as far as the tool is concerned. A stray `archive` once moved over a thousand entries out of
// reach in a single unattended command. This module calls `add` (via `store.ts`'s
// `appendEntry`, for the report's `lessons[]`), `recall`'s own machinery indirectly through
// `readEntries` (for the duplicate-key count), and `reindex` (via `fts.ts`'s `buildIndex`,
// LAST, only after a successful push — `index.db` is gitignored and derived, and a pull can
// bring in entries the local index has never seen). Nothing in this file calls
// `archiveOlderThan` or `compactActive`, and nothing ever should — a test asserts their names
// never appear in any git call-log entry either.
//
// --- lessons[] reconcile — the documented winner (Locked 15) -------------------------------
//
// `syncKnowledge` accepts the report's `lessons[]` (KB entry objects) and applies each one via
// `store.ts`'s `appendEntry`, keyed by `key` — exactly the same upsert semantics every other
// `drawbar-kb add` call gets, never re-derived or fought here. Per `store.ts:45-95`
// (`sameKnowledge`/`appendEntry`, already verified by the lead): a re-add of IDENTICAL
// knowledge (every field but `ts` matching an existing entry with the same key) is a silent
// no-op (`{written:false, superseded:false}`); a re-add that changes any other field SUPERSEDES
// the prior copy in place, archiving the old one. DOCUMENTED WINNER: the report's lesson is
// applied AFTER whatever inline entries already landed during the run, so when the two
// disagree, the REPORT's version supersedes the inline one — last write wins BY CONTENT, not by
// which was written to disk first. This module does not compare, dedupe, or pre-filter
// `lessons[]` against what is already on disk; it delegates the whole decision to
// `appendEntry`.

//
// Two REPRODUCED, first-hand failures, both leaving a knowledge write in a store nothing ever
// syncs, silently ("a wrong store answers with less; it does not fail" — the drawbar-knowledge
// skill's own warning):
//
//   (1) A project's gitignored `.drawbar/config.json` carried no `memoryDir`. `drawbar-kb path`,
//       run from the PROJECT directory during an inline mid-run `drawbar-kb add`, therefore fell
//       back to `project-config.ts`'s default — `<project repo root>/.drawbar/memory` — which is
//       an ordinary gitignored per-worktree directory in the PRODUCT repo, not the separate,
//       git-tracked KNOWLEDGE repo `envDir`/`kbDir` name. Every inline write during that run
//       landed there instead, invisible to every other session, and `kb-sync`'s own sync loop
//       never looks at it because it only ever touches `kbDir`.
//   (2) A caller passed `envDir` where `--dir` (`kbDir`) belonged, so `appendEntry` wrote
//       `knowledge.jsonl` straight into the knowledge repo's ROOT rather than into
//       `.drawbar/memory`. Not `kbDir`, so nothing downstream (`syncKnowledge`, `recall`) ever
//       reads it either.
//
// Both are checked in `knowledgePreflight`, not `syncKnowledge`: preflight is the ONE place a
// ship run is guaranteed to visit before any inline write happens, so this is where "wrong
// store" gets caught before it can happen quietly for an entire run.

// --- the envDir trust root (R5/F2) ------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `envDir` reaches `git -C envDir` on every call either verb makes, and a path reaching `git -C`
// from mutable state is a CODE EXECUTION sink, not merely a wrong-directory bug: git reads that
// directory's own `.git/config`, so `core.sshCommand` runs on a fetch/pull and a
// `reference-transaction` hook runs on a successful ref update. `isCleanAbsolutePath` is a SHAPE
// check only (absolute, no `..` segment) — it says nothing whatever about WHOSE repository the
// value names.
//
// Before R5 the comment at the CLI entry point claimed the trust root was
// `commands/drawbar-ship.md` §6 "deriving it from Preflight's already-validated
// resolved_config". That trust root DID NOT EXIST. §6 is a separate Bash invocation from
// Preflight's — no shell state survives between tool calls — so it re-derived `ENV_DIR` from a
// prose placeholder (`RESOLVED="<Preflight's resolved_config JSON>"`) that the MODEL fills in,
// checked only that the result was non-empty and not the literal "null", and never referenced
// `$CONFIG` at all. Any value the agent's own context could be induced to produce was accepted.
//
// So the check moved INTO the module: both verbs take a REQUIRED `--config-path`, parse that
// file with `parseShipConfig` (never a second parser here), and refuse unless its `envDir`
// EQUALS the `--env-dir` they were handed. The refusal happens before any git call against
// `envDir` and before any store mutation; a call-counter spy proves it.
//
// --- R7 (PCO-371): why the equality alone was still a TAUTOLOGY -----------------------------
//
// R5 shipped that equality and claimed "a caller that skips or rewrites the runbook cannot skip
// it either". That claim was FALSE, in exactly the way the comment R5 deleted was false, and it
// was reproduced end to end against this CLI with no fakes: `--config-path` was an ordinary argv
// flag validated only for SHAPE, so a caller naming a hostile `--env-dir` simply wrote a config
// file saying `{"envDir":"<that same dir>"}` and named it as its own trust root. Both sides of
// the equality came from the same argv. A `reference-transaction` hook in the named repository
// then ran on the commit this loop makes. That is verbatim the corollary in MUST-CHECK
// `path-from-mutable-state-into-git-C-is-code-execution`: "if the new observation is anchored at
// a path taken from the same untrusted object, the tautology just moved one indirection deeper".
//
// Two checks close it, and neither is expressible as an equality between two argv values:
//
//   1. ANCHORED LOCATION. `configPath` must be the very path `ship-config.ts`'s own
//      `resolveConfigPath` derives from THIS PROCESS's environment and working directory —
//      `$DRAWBAR_SHIP_CONFIG`, or `<cwd>/.drawbar/ship.config.json`. Compared after resolving
//      symlinks on both sides, because the runbook legitimately passes the `readlink -f` form
//      while `$DRAWBAR_SHIP_CONFIG` may be relative or itself a symlink. An argv flag can no
//      longer choose WHICH file vouches for `--env-dir`; it can only name the one the process's
//      own environment already points at. (Same primitive, not a second copy of the default.)
//
//      SCOPE, stated rather than implied: this moves the trust root from argv to the process's
//      environment and working directory — the same trust root `ship-config.ts validate` and every
//      fence in `commands/drawbar-ship.md` already rest on, and what the KB entry means by "the
//      operator-authored config". It does NOT defend against a caller that can also choose the cwd
//      or export `$DRAWBAR_SHIP_CONFIG` and plant an untracked config there; that is a strictly
//      stronger capability than passing a flag, and closing it would need a trust root outside the
//      process environment entirely. The runbook's own two §6 guards are the other half here.
//   2. NOT TRACKED BY GIT. The repo's own MUST-CHECK `config-file-must-not-be-tracked-by-git`,
//      applied here with the already-injected runner: `git -C <dirname> ls-files
//      --error-unmatch <realpath>` exiting 0 means a branch under review COMMITTED the config,
//      which is the one signal that distinguishes an operator-authored config from a planted
//      one. Deliberately the SAME guard `commands/drawbar-ship.md` runs, including its
//      fail-OPEN-on-git-failure shape (only exit 0 refuses): a `git` failure — the config's
//      directory not being a repository at all is the ordinary case — is not the vulnerability
//      this guards against, so it must not become a new halt.
//
// ORDER: the tracked-config check runs LAST, after every filesystem-and-parse check above it,
// so the pure refusals still make ZERO git calls of any kind (proven by a call-counter spy), and
// so the one git call it does make is anchored at the ANCHOR-VERIFIED config path rather than at
// anything argv chose. It still precedes every `git -C envDir` call and every store mutation.

      //      them. On a partially-staged file (hunk A staged, hunk B only in the worktree) the
      //      scoped commit lands BOTH hunks, whereas an unscoped commit lands only hunk A.
      //      That is acceptable — in fact preferable — here: `git add` on these exact paths ran
      //      immediately above, so index and worktree agree, and where they DON'T (an inline
      //      `drawbar-kb add` landing in the microseconds between the add and the commit) the
      //      newer worktree content is precisely what we want committed. Committing the stale
      //      indexed copy instead would leave the file dirty and trip the precondition below.
      //   3. A pathspec matching nothing git knows about exits 1 (`error: pathspec ... did not
      //      match any file(s) known to git`), not 128.
      //   4. A pathspec with no changes exits 1 (`nothing to commit`). Unreachable here: the
      //      scoped diff above already established a staged change on these same paths.
      //   5. A partial commit is REFUSED during a MERGE (exit 128, `fatal: cannot do a partial
      //      commit during a merge`) but is ACCEPTED during a REBASE, and the difference matters
      //      because only one of those two states is reachable. Both re-verified on real git
      //      2.43.0 in R7, because R5's comment here asserted the case was "unreachable" and that
      //      step 3 below would have caught it regardless — and BOTH halves of that were wrong:
      //        - The reachable state is a mid-REBASE tree, and this module's own non-retried
      //          `pull_failed` is what LEAVES one behind. A later run against that wedged repo
      //          reaches this commit with `UU <conflicted file>` in the tree; the scoped form
      //          then SUCCEEDS (`[detached HEAD ...] kb sync`, code 0) where the unscoped form
      //          refused with 128 (`Committing is not possible because you have unmerged
      //          files`). So this is a genuine behaviour change R5 introduced, not a no-op.
      //        - It cannot be "caught by the dirty precondition below": the precondition runs
      //          AFTER this commit, deliberately (see step 3).
      //      The overall verdict is still FAIL CLOSED, which is why this stays a recorded

// The trust root now lives in this module (`assertEnvDirTrusted`, applied at the top of BOTH
// `syncKnowledge` and `knowledgePreflight`), which is why `--config-path` below is REQUIRED on
// both verbs rather than optional.
//
// CORRECTED AGAIN IN R7: R5's version of this note went on to claim that a caller "cannot obtain a
// git call from either verb without naming the operator-authored config". `--config-path` alone
// never established "operator-authored" — an arbitrary shape-clean path was accepted, so the
// caller supplied BOTH sides of the equality and the sink stayed open (reproduced). What makes the
// config non-arbitrary is the pair of checks documented on `assertEnvDirTrusted`: `--config-path`
// must resolve to the very file `resolveConfigPath` derives from THIS PROCESS's own
// `$DRAWBAR_SHIP_CONFIG`/cwd, and that file must not be tracked by git. Note the operational
// consequence for the runbook: `DRAWBAR_SHIP_CONFIG`, when used at all, must be EXPORTED, because
// the anchor is read from the environment this process inherits.
