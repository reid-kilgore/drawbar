// The state model for the stacked-PR redesign (PCO-363), landed before anything writes it
// (PCO-365, R2). A run that resolves the wrong base produces a PR whose diff silently
// contains another story's work — plausible-looking, green, and hard to catch. This module
// exists to make that failure mode a named refusal instead.
//
// Two distinct pure verdict functions, same house style as scripts/lib/ship-config.ts and
// scripts/lib/run-state.ts (named `reason` + human `detail` on every refusal, injected
// `Runner`s so `git` is never called from ambient state, Locked 5's "tests pass with `git`
// absent from PATH" holds because every git call is injected):
//
//   - `resolveBase` — the branch a NEW story should be based on: the run's configured
//     `baseBranch` if `state.stack` is empty (this is the first story), otherwise the
//     LAST-appended stack entry's `branch` (Locked A — never the configured base, for any
//     story after the first). Pure; touches no git at all.
//   - `assertChainIntact` — re-verifies a resumed run's recorded stack against the actual
//     repository: each entry's `base` must still match Locked A's own rule (pure, no git),
//     and each entry's `branch`/`base` must still exist and the chain must still hold
//     (`base` still an ancestor of `branch`) — a rebase of a predecessor between runs is
//     exactly the crash-resume failure mode this exists to catch.
//
//     Trunk link (stack[0] only): the first story's base is the configured trunk, and several
//     sessions may share one checkout and fast-forward its LOCAL trunk branch at any time.
//     Judging stack[0] against local `refs/heads/<baseBranch>` therefore refused every other run's
//     intact stack as `branch_moved` after each fast-forward. The trunk moving forward is
//     harmless; what is a hazard is an INNER link breaking (story N+1 no longer on story N). So
//     stack[0] is judged against the remote-tracking ref `refs/remotes/origin/<baseBranch>`
//     instead, and only for (b) existence, (c) a merge base exists (related history), and (d) at
//     least one commit beyond it. Inner links (i > 0) are unchanged. The caller fetches first.
//
//     Scope (IMPORTANT 4): every git-backed check above reads LOCAL refs
//     (`refs/heads/<name>`) in the clone at `projectDir` — this module never fetches. The
//     design is about pushed branches with GitHub PRs stacked on them; a remote force-push of
//     a predecessor BETWEEN runs, with no corresponding local fetch, leaves the local ref
//     stale, so `merge-base` passes against stale history and the chain reports intact while
//     the PR on GitHub already shows a different diff. Detecting that is explicitly OUT OF
//     SCOPE for R2. Fail-closed corollary: a `--single-branch` clone taken on a branch OTHER
//     than `baseBranch` has no local `refs/heads/<baseBranch>` ref at all and would refuse
//     `base_missing` even in an otherwise healthy repository — that is the safe direction for
//     this gap to fail in. (A `--single-branch` clone taken ON `baseBranch` is unaffected:
//     verified on real git that `refs/heads/<baseBranch>` is present and `rev-parse` exits 0.)
//
// `scripts/lib/run-state.ts`'s `StackEntry` carries no `sha` — chain integrity is re-derived
// live from `git` rather than pinned to a recorded commit, so a legitimate rebase of a
// predecessor does not require a state-file rewrite.

//              `refs/tags/<x>` ahead of `refs/heads/<x>`, so a bare name here would let a tag
//              of the SAME name silently answer the ancestry question about a different
//              object than the one just verified to exist in steps 3/4 — reproduced against

//              `branch_moved` refusal to `{"ok":true}`). Verified separately: exit 0 means
//              `base` IS an ancestor of `branch`; exit 1 means it genuinely is NOT (including
//              two unrelated histories) — that is "moved," not a git error; any OTHER
//              non-zero exit (128 observed for a bogus/missing ref) is a git ERROR and must
//              route to `git_failed`, never be misread as "moved" (a broken repository must
//              not silently present as an ordinary rebase). For i === 0 this step is instead
//              `merge-base refs/remotes/origin/<base> refs/heads/<branch>` (no `--is-ancestor`):
//              exit 0 prints a merge base, exit 1 means no merge base (unrelated histories, ->

//
// What a resume must do about the wreckage a dead agent left, as a NAMED plan rather than as
// prose a model may or may not follow. The crash this exists for left a branch with zero
// commits and a 509-line untracked file in the tree; a naive retry runs `git checkout -b
// <branch>`, dies on "already exists", and the recovery path fails on the wreckage of the first
// failure instead of recovering from it.
//
// This function is a READ-ONLY OBSERVER. It performs no git write — the runbook's Crash
// recovery section executes the plan. That split is not decoration: rule 3 of PCO-381 forbids
// orchestrator git writes against a worktree an agent holds, and a planner that also acted
// would have to know whether an agent is live, which is exactly the question `in_flight`
// (run-state.ts) already owns.
//
// The four plans, and why the two destructive-looking ones are safe:
//
//   - `resume_on_branch` — the branch holds >= 1 commit. That is the crashed run's real output;
//     it is resumed on and NEVER reset. `dirty` tells the runbook to commit the tree onto it
//     first, which is what the runbook already said to do before this function existed.
//   - `salvage_and_reset` — nothing is committed on the branch, but the tree carries work.
//     Preserve it on `drawbar/salvage/<branch>` FIRST, then drop the commitless branch.
//   - `reset_branch` — a commitless branch and a clean tree. There is nothing to preserve;
//     dropping the branch is what lets the re-dispatch cut it again.
//   - `clean_start` — no branch, clean tree. The crash never got that far.
//
// "Preserve any partial work somewhere retrievable — never discard it silently" is enforced in
// two independent places, so neither alone is load-bearing: this planner refuses
// `salvage_ref_exists` rather than overwriting an earlier crash's salvage, and the runbook
// executes `git branch -d` (never `-D`), which git itself refuses on a branch holding unmerged
// commits. A wrong plan therefore still cannot destroy committed work.
//
// The salvage branch name is DERIVED from the story branch rather than recorded in the run
// state. That is deliberate: recording it would mean an eleventh key in run-state.ts's pinned
// schema and a migration for every existing state file, to store a value that is already a pure
// function of the branch. It stays retrievable by construction — `git branch --list
// 'drawbar/salvage/*'` enumerates every salvage a run ever made — and that is documented in the

// `resolved_config` — that is what a resumed run has (R3's bash runbook re-invokes this per
// story, never carrying a separately-sourced config of its own). Both write a JSON verdict to
// stdout for `jq` to read — including a `{ok: false, reason, detail}` business refusal, which
// is a different failure class from a CLI-usage error (bad flags, unreadable/malformed state
// file): the latter write to stderr with EMPTY stdout, mirroring ship-config.ts's CLI
// end-to-end convention, so a caller piping stdout into `jq` never sees a partial object for a
// usage error, but DOES see a structured verdict for a business refusal.

// lives in the agent-writable run-state file, so handing its `projectDir` copy straight to
// `git -C` would let that file alone repoint every ancestry check at an attacker-controlled
// repository — an absolute-path-and-no-`..` shape check does not help, since it constrains
// the shape of the path, never whose repository it names. `--project-dir` is the
// operator-authored trust root instead (R3's runbook sources it from
// `ship-config.ts validate`'s own resolved output, never from the state file); the flag value
// and the state's copy must AGREE (compared via `resolve()`) before any git call, or the run
// refuses `project_dir_untrusted` with the git runner never invoked. `resolve-base` makes no
// git call at all, so `--project-dir` is forbidden there — accepting-but-ignoring it would
// invite a caller to believe it does something.
