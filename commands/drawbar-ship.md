# drawbar ship

Take one story from `Todo` up to the point a human takes over, then stop. It never
merges — the operator reviews and merges. Driven by
`/loop /drawbar-ship <TEAM>-####` it burns a parent down overnight; invoked bare it does
exactly one story, which is the right way to run it attended.

**You are a thin orchestrator.** The implementation and the review loop all happen inside a
dispatched `drawbar-story-lead` agent, so its diffs, test output and review bodies never
enter your context. You hold only: the snapshot, the Linear writes, the KB push,
and the burn-down.

**You own every Linear write.** The story-lead has no Linear tools at all. That is
deliberate and mechanical: it is why a story agent cannot set a completion status.

**This extends `/drawbar-work` past its hand-off point** — that command opens a PR and
stops, because humans own everything downstream of code-is-up-for-review. This one keeps
going instead of stopping there: it picks the next story, delegates it, and advances,
story after story — but it never merges the PR it opens.

Sequential only. **Never** run two stories concurrently — they are dependency-ordered, and
story N is based on story N−1's branch, which does not exist until N−1 has finished.

## The stack model

Each story becomes one pull request, and the pull requests form a **stack**: every PR is based
on the one before it, so each diff shows only its own story's changes and every branch is
buildable on its own. Stories are dependency-ordered, so this is required rather than
incidental — story N+1 generally does not compile against the configured base at all.

**How a base is chosen (Locked A).** The base is the configured `baseBranch` for the **first**
story of a run, and the **previous story's branch** for every story after it. Exactly one thing
produces that value — `scripts/lib/stack.ts`'s `resolve-base` verb, invoked in §4 — and it is
**never re-derived in bash**, never lifted out of the run-state file by hand, and never left to
a default. `resolve-base` is the only producer that shape-gates the branch name with
`isValidRefName`; the run state it reads is agent-writable, so a base copied straight out of
`stack[]` carries no validation at all. Omitting `--base` is the same failure from the other
side: `gh` would fall back to the repo's default branch, producing a PR whose diff carries every
earlier story's work too — green, plausible, and near-impossible to spot in the morning. The
story-lead is **handed** its base and cuts from it; it never resolves one.

**What `flagged` means.** A `flagged` story is one whose single fix pass left Important findings
alive. **The PR opens anyway**, annotated with an `## Unresolved findings` section, and **the
stack continues on top of it** — the next story is based on this story's branch exactly as if it
had come back clean. A story that is 90% right belongs in front of the operator at 8am,
annotated, rather than costing the rest of the night's throughput.

**"No PR could be opened" differs in kind from `flagged`, not in degree.** With no pull request
there is no branch for the next story to base on, so the chain has no anchor and the run
**parks and halts** (§4, Outcome A). Never collapse the two: `flagged` continues stacking, a
missing PR stops the night.

**The operator's contract in the morning: review bottom-up and merge bottom-up, in order.** The
stack was built bottom-up, so only the bottom PR's diff is meaningful against the configured
base; every PR above it is meaningful only once the one below has landed. Reviewing or merging
out of order reads a diff against a base that has moved.

**Locked F — `drawbar-ship` never merges, never verifies a merge, and never inspects whether one
happened.** Keeping the stack mergeable is the operator's job. **No detection or repair of
out-of-order merges exists or is planned** — that is a contract, not a gap awaiting a follow-up,
so do not file one for it. Building it back would re-introduce exactly the merge-state gating
this design deleted: nothing here can know whether a merge was clean or in order without the
gate that made the old design expensive and unwanted. If a stack does get merged out of order,
the recovery is a human rebase, and this command has no opinion about it.

Dirty `$PROJECT_DIR` tree → **do not halt blindly**; go to *Crash recovery* below. A dirty tree
is the signature of a crashed run, and halting on it means every crash costs a human.

Confirm the Linear MCP answers (`list_issue_statuses` for team **<TEAM>**). If unavailable,
**halt** — §1's pick rule and the blocker gate both read issue status, and neither can
function without it.

**Assert-or-create the `found-in-review` label.** Step 3 mandates it; it did not exist
until 2026-07-27, so earlier runs silently dropped it (<TEAM>-L1 and <TEAM>-L2 carry no labels).
`list_issue_labels` for the team; create it if missing. Never assume it exists.

## 0. Snapshot the story list (first invocation only)

State file: `$ENV_DIR/.drawbar/runs/<ARG>.json` (gitignored, absolute). If absent, create
it in the PINNED schema below (Locked 12) — `scripts/lib/run-state.ts`'s `parseRunState`
rejects any other shape loudly, structural-only, never silently tolerating an unknown key:

```
{
  "arg": "<the id this run was invoked with>",
  "invoked_as": "parent" | "leaf",
  "started_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "order_rationale": "<how the snapshot below was topologically sorted>",
  "snapshot": ["<story id>", ...],
  "stories_done": [],
  "in_flight": null,
  "stack": [],
  "subissues_filed": [],
  "resolved_config": { /* Preflight's $RESOLVED, verbatim — ship-config.ts's ResolvedConfig */ }
}
```

The canonical story-list key is **`snapshot`** — never `stories`. Persist `resolved_config`
at this point too (T0), copying Preflight's already-validated `$RESOLVED` verbatim: it is
`scripts/lib/ship-config.ts`'s `ResolvedConfig` shape (the six configured keys plus
`observed`), never a second hand-copied shape.

The shape of `snapshot`/`invoked_as` depends on what you were invoked with:

- **`$ARGUMENTS` is a parent** (has sub-issues) → `list_issues` with `parentId`; record
  every child whose status is `Todo`.
- **`$ARGUMENTS` is a leaf story** (no sub-issues) → a single-story snapshot containing
  just that id. Record `"invoked_as": "leaf"` so later steps and any resume know not to
  look for siblings.

**Then topologically sort the snapshot by `blockedBy` relations among its own members**, and
persist that order. `list_issues` returns creation/update order, not dependency order, so
without this the run order is whatever the API happens to hand back.

> This is not theoretical. For <TEAM>-P the API returned <TEAM>-A first and <TEAM>-C before
> <TEAM>-B — and <TEAM>-C is `blockedBy` <TEAM>-B. Picking <TEAM>-C first would hit the
> step 1 blocker rule and **halt the entire night** on a blocker that was merely later in
> the same queue.

Members with no relation between them keep their `list_issues` order — a stable tiebreak,
not a judgment call.

**Locked 11 — an empty relation set is not evidence of independence.** Establish each
member's dependencies from **both** Linear's `blockedBy` relations **and** its own
`## Dependencies` prose section, never from relations alone: "no edges returned" from the
relation query is not the same fact as "no edges exist." Independence must be **stated**, not
inferred from silence: a member counts as independent only when both sources give a positive
artifact saying so — the relation query actually returned (even an empty result) **and** the
issue carries a `## Dependencies` section (even one that states "none"). A member with **no**
`## Dependencies` section at all halts, and a member whose relation query **errored** halts
too — neither is evidence of independence, both are missing evidence.

Distinguish the two by the **tool result itself**, not by its contents: a call that returned a
result object — even one carrying an empty relation list — is a positive artifact; a call that
raised an error, timed out, or returned no result object at all is a failed read. Record which
of the two you observed for each member, so the halt condition is something you can actually
evaluate rather than infer. An unrecordable premise is not a gate. If dependency information
cannot be established for a snapshot member from either source, **halt and notify**.

This halt applies to a **multi-member** snapshot, where ordering is what is being established.
A single-member snapshot (`"invoked_as": "leaf"`) has no ordering to establish and does not
halt on a missing section. Note the interaction with step 3: sub-issues this command files
carry no `## Dependencies` section of their own, so step 3 writes one — otherwise a triaged
finding becomes a `Todo` child, joins the next parent run's snapshot, and halts it.

If the relations contain a cycle, halt and notify too: that is a planning error no unattended
run should paper over.

Also record `started_at` and `stories_done: []`.

**This snapshot is the entire scope of the run.** Sub-issues filed *during* the run are
deliberately **not** added to it.

> Why: the termination condition is "no `Todo` children left," but each story's review can
> file more. Without a snapshot the loop may never end. More importantly, a bug found at
> 2am has had none of the planning every snapshotted story went through — no spec, no
> `Locked` decisions, no acceptance criteria. Implementing it unattended is exactly the
> case where there is nobody to ask.
>
> One real exception has occurred: <TEAM>-#### was created mid-run as a **hard prerequisite**
> that made its parent story physically unshippable (two CI gates contradicted each other).
> If a discovered issue blocks the *current* story outright, you may work it — but say so
> in the notification, and add it to the snapshot explicitly so the record matches reality.

## 1. Pick the story, and clear its blockers

Next id in the snapshot not in `stories_done`, whose Linear status is still `Todo`.
Snapshot exhausted → go to *Finishing the run*.

**Blocker rule.** A `blockedBy` relation is resolved by exactly one of the following three
clauses — but they do not all mean the same thing. Clauses 1-2 **clear** the blocker: the
gate is satisfied, proceed with the current story. Clause 3 is different in kind, not just in
number: it means your **pick** was wrong, not that the blocker cleared — its outcome is
**re-pick, never proceed**.

1. the blocker is `Done` / `Rolled Out`, **or**
2. the blocker **has children** and all of its non-`Unplanned` children are `Done`, **or**
3. **(re-pick, not a clearance)** the **unsatisfied** blocker is **itself a member of this
   snapshot** and not yet in `stories_done`. Membership is **exact, case-sensitive equality**
   against the `snapshot[]` array in the run-state file — a partial, prefix, or
   case-insensitive match is **not** membership. The topological sort in step 0 was wrong, or
   a relation was added mid-run. **Re-sort and continue**: re-sort the snapshot, **persist**
   the new order and `order_rationale` to the state file (step 0 already requires the order
   be persisted — a crash after an unpersisted re-sort would resume on the stale order), then
   return to the **top of this step** and re-pick. The re-sort re-runs step 0's sort **in
   full, including its cycle check** — a relation added mid-run is exactly what introduces a
   cycle, and step 0's halt is the only thing that catches one. **Terminator:** **halt and
   notify** if any story is picked twice within this step — not merely if the re-sort leaves
   the pick unchanged. Comparing against the immediately-previous pick alone misses a
   two-cycle: a mid-run `A blockedBy B` plus `B blockedBy A` yields X→Y→X→Y, where every
   re-sort *does* change the pick and a previous-pick-only terminator never fires.

Otherwise **halt and notify**. Never proceed past a blocker with `Todo` or `In Progress`
children. An **unsatisfied** blocker **outside** the snapshot always halts — clause 3 never
applies to it: clause 3 only ever re-picks, it can never itself clear a blocker, so a blocker
genuinely outside the snapshot can only ever reach this halt.

> Clause 2 exists because a real run hit a blocker sitting in `Unplanned` whose seven
> children were all `Done` — a tracking issue, not live work. A literal gate ends the night
> on bookkeeping; ignoring blockers ships on a real gap. This is the judgment nobody is
> awake to make, so it is written down instead.

## 2. Delegate the whole story

**Before dispatching, `in_flight` is the authoritative duplicate-dispatch guard (Locked
13).** Check the state file: a non-null `in_flight` means a dispatch may already be running.

- If `now - in_flight.agent_dispatched_at` is **within** 2x the heartbeat (see below), this
  is a fresh, live dispatch — **no-op, do not dispatch a second agent at all, for ANY story,
  while `in_flight` is non-null.** The guard is per-run, not per-story: `in_flight` names one
  story-lead dispatch at a time regardless of which story it names, so a different story
  never justifies a second dispatch either.
- If it **exceeds** 2x the heartbeat (strict `>` — exactly 2x is still fresh, a deliberate
  boundary choice), the prior dispatch is presumed crashed — go to *Crash recovery* instead
  of no-op'ing forever. (The repo probe used there is a crash-recovery tool only, with a
  blind window between dispatch and first commit — it read "indistinguishable from never
  started" one minute after a live dispatch, so it must never gate a fresh in-window check.)
- If `in_flight` is `null`, proceed to dispatch below.

`scripts/lib/run-state.ts` (`dispatchVerdict` / `maybeDispatch`) implements this verdict as a
pure function with an injected clock — follow the same boundary and ordering as
`dispatchVerdict` / `maybeDispatch` here rather than reimplementing the logic ad hoc.

**Then assert the chain before dispatching — never branch off an incomplete base.** Story N+1
is dispatched onto story N's branch (Locked A), so story N's branch must hold **at least one
commit beyond its own base**. A branch with zero commits passes every other integrity check
there is: its base is still an ancestor of it, trivially, because they are the same commit.
That is exactly what a dead implementer leaves behind, and it is the difference between one
failed story and three garbage PRs stacked on nothing. `assert-chain` refuses it as
`branch_commitless` — a reason deliberately distinct from `branch_moved`, because a commitless
branch is safe to reset and a moved one never is.

This gate is **executable, not advisory**. A rule stated only in prose can be reasoned past;
this one refuses.

```bash

# session's context is a trust root — least of all the run state, which is agent-writable.

echo "CHAIN_OK: every recorded branch exists, still descends from its base, and holds commits"
```

A refusal here **parks the story and halts the run** — it never skips ahead to a later one.
`branch_commitless` in particular means a recorded predecessor is empty, so there is nothing to
stack on; go to *Crash recovery*, which is where an empty branch gets resolved.

**Post a `save_comment` on the story before dispatching** — that implementation is starting,
with the branch name and timestamp. A crashed run that never commits leaves *no* record of
intent otherwise; this comment is what makes a crash recoverable. Move the story to
`In Progress`.

**Write `in_flight` at dispatch, and re-arm the heartbeat (F13).** Set
`in_flight: {story, agent_dispatched_at: <now>}` in the state file, where `<now>` is a **UTC
ISO 8601 instant** — the exact form `new Date().toISOString()` produces (e.g.
`2026-07-28T03:14:15.000Z`). Never a bare `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` or any other non-ISO form:
those parse as LOCAL time, not UTC, so the same literal timestamp means a different instant
depending on the machine's timezone — silently corrupting every later staleness comparison.
The heartbeat is **2700-3600 seconds** (45-60 minutes) and is **re-armed at every dispatch** —
this dispatch's `agent_dispatched_at` is what the 2x-heartbeat staleness check above measures
from, which is exactly what makes that threshold well-defined rather than a moving target.

Then dispatch **one** `drawbar-story-lead` agent (Opus). The brief must carry:

- the story id, full description, and acceptance criteria
- every `Locked` decision and `MUST-CHECK:` verbatim
- `$KB` (absolute), `$PROJECT_DIR`, `$REPO`, `$BASE_BRANCH`, and the branch name — prefer
  Linear's `gitBranchName` from `get_issue`, which guarantees the PR auto-links
- that it must **not** merge and has no Linear authority

It returns the JSON report in its §7: `{story, status, branch, base, parked_reason, spec_source,
reviewed_sha, head_sha, findings, dedup, mutation_pairs, out_of_scope, false_claims, lessons, summary}`. It carries no `pr` — it opens none; §4 below is what opens
the PR and learns its number. **Do not ask it for the diff.** If you find yourself wanting
one, the split is not working.

`status: parked` → skip to *Parking a story*.

## 3. File out-of-scope findings as sub-issues

**Search the parent's existing children before you file anything.** `list_issues` with the story's
parent as `parentId`, then match every `out_of_scope` and every `findings[]` entry against those
children on `dedup_key`: a child whose body carries the same `claim_hash` is the same defect already
filed from an earlier story's review, and so is a child carrying the same `file` and the same `line`
under a claim that restates it. A defect re-found by a later story is not new work — one story
re-found a defect an earlier story had already filed, and it was filed a second time.

- **On a match, `save_comment` on the existing sub-issue and file nothing new.** The comment names
  the story that re-found it, which reviewer reported it, and this story's branch — that naming is
  the point, because an uncommented match leaves the earlier sub-issue looking stale rather than
  re-confirmed. A second sub-issue for one defect splits the discussion across two ids and gets
  triaged as new work.
- **On no match, file it** under the rules below, and put the finding's `dedup_key` in the body.
  That key is what the next run matches against; a body without one is unmatchable forever after,
  and the search above degrades to nothing for every story that follows.

**Print every match and every suppression in the run output**, one line each: the `dedup_key`, the
sub-issue id it resolved to, and whether you commented or filed. The story-lead's own `dedup` array
is printed here too, so a finding the two reviewers both raised and the story-lead collapsed into
one is visible as a collapse rather than as a finding that went missing. **Nothing is dropped
silently** — a suppression nobody can see is indistinguishable from a finding that was never
reported.

**Mandatory, not discretionary.** For each entry in `out_of_scope`, `save_issue` a new
sub-issue under the same parent: title naming the bug not the symptom; description naming the
file and symbol (not a line number — the issue outlives the tree), what is wrong, why it is out
of scope here, and the PR that surfaced it; status
`Unplanned`; label `found-in-review`. Never file it `Todo` — `Unplanned → Todo` is the human
triage gate, and this command has no authority to walk a finding through it unattended.

**File one sub-issue for every surviving `findings[]` entry too**, under the same rules —
status `Unplanned`, label `found-in-review`, a `## Dependencies` section — and record its id
alongside the `out_of_scope` ones. `findings[]` carries the Critical and Important findings
that outlived the story-lead's one fix pass, unfixed **security** findings included, and §4's
`## Unresolved findings` section is allowed to name a finding by sub-issue id and title only:
with no sub-issue filed here there is no id for §4 to render, so a flagged story's surviving
findings would be unpublishable and would die with the session exactly as an unfiled
`out_of_scope` entry does. Put the finding's `detail` in the sub-issue body — a Linear issue
is not world-readable the way the pull request is, which is the whole reason the split exists.

**The title of every sub-issue filed here carries no `file:line`, no path, and no quoted
source** — those go in the body only, and this rule outranks any wording that reads as
encouraging them, because §4 publishes the title verbatim in a public PR body while forbidding
exactly those three things there. A title like "path traversal in `scripts/lib/stack.ts:165`"
satisfies "name the bug not the symptom" and still announces an unpatched detail to every repo
watcher; name the bug and its component instead.

**Give every filed sub-issue a `## Dependencies` section**, stating `none — filed from review
of <PR>` when it has none. Step 0 halts on a snapshot member that carries no such section, and
a finding filed here becomes exactly that member once a human triages it `Unplanned → Todo`.
Omitting the section here is a halt on some later night, in a different command, with nothing
pointing back to this step.

Not added to the snapshot — they wait for the next run.

> The reviewer agents explicitly "return categorized findings; do not write to Linear," and
> the story-lead has no Linear tools. If you skip this, the finding dies with the session.

## 4. Open the stacked PR

**This step is the only thing in the whole run that opens a pull request.** The story-lead's
own §6 pushes its branch and stops there — it opens none. Were both to open one, they would
submit the identical head+base pair on the run's first story, GitHub would refuse the second
with a 422, and the run would park on story 1 every night.

This step resolves the base by delegating to `stack.ts` — never re-derived in bash — and
opens the PR with an explicit `--base <base>` flag; `--base` is never omitted (Locked A): the
default would silently fall back to the repo's default branch, producing a PR whose diff
carries every earlier story's work too — green, plausible, and near-impossible to spot in
the morning.

`FLAGGED` comes from the story-lead's §7 report `status` field, on the `ok | flagged`
contract: `flagged` becomes the JSON boolean `true`, `ok` becomes `false` — a `parked` story
never reaches this step at all, because §2 routes it straight to *Parking a story*. On a
**flagged** story, the PR body carries an `## Unresolved findings` section, built before
`gh pr create` runs, never appended after. That section names each surviving finding by
its filed sub-issue id and title only — never the finding body, `file:line`, a finding's
`dedup_key` or any of its `file` / `line` / `claim_hash` fields, or a quoted source excerpt;
the full write-up already lives in the sub-issue §3 filed for it, and republishing it in a
public PR body announces an unpatched detail to every repo watcher before the operator's
morning review. The `dedup_key` is named here beside `file:line` because it is the same
location in structured form: a serializer that drops `detail` and emits the key has published
the location anyway, and a ban worded against one spelling is not a ban on the field.

**Every PR body opens with a review-provenance line, on a flagged story and a clean one alike**,
built before `gh pr create` runs: `reviewed at <reviewed_sha> from <spec_source>; N commits since`,
where `<reviewed_sha>` is what the reviewers read, `<spec_source>` is `cli` or `brief` — the source
that review actually read the spec from — and `N` is the commit count between the sha and the
story-lead's `head_sha`, all three taken from that report. The fix pass commits after the reviewers
read the diff, so every review is stale by construction and `N` is normally non-zero; stating it is
the whole point, and no second review round closes it. **State `N` even when it is zero** — an
omitted line reads exactly like a review that was never stale, which is the claim this line exists
to stop anyone making. **State `<spec_source>` even when it is `cli`** — a review that never reached
Linear is blind to an AMENDED banner, a superseded section and a struck decision, and on this
unattended path the PR body is the only place a reader can find that out; printing it only when it
is `brief` makes its absence the signal, and an absence is what nobody notices at 3am.

**Shape-check both shas before you build that line, and park the story if either refuses.**
`reviewed_sha` and `head_sha` reach you as free text from a subagent that read a branch under
review, and the story-lead's contract copies them through verbatim — nothing between there and here
has looked at them. Each must match `^[0-9a-f]{40}$`, and each must resolve in the repository this PR opens
against: `git -C "$PROJECT_DIR" cat-file -e "<sha>^{commit}"`. `N` is then
`git -C "$PROJECT_DIR" rev-list --count "<reviewed_sha>..<head_sha>"`, anchored the same way and
never derived from whatever branch happens to be checked out. A sha that is malformed, or that does
not resolve here, parks the story with that as the reason — it attests to a tree this repository
does not have, and a foreign 40-hex sha is shape-identical to a real one once it is in the PR body.
Where the two reviewers read different shas, name both, one line each.

**Nothing carries over into the fence below.** No shell state survives across two Bash tool
calls, so every value it consumes is re-derived inside it from one source of truth — a fresh
`ship-config.ts validate`, behind the same two `$CONFIG` guards Preflight runs, because
`$CONFIG` is re-resolved from `$PWD` and a branch under review can plant one. An ambient
exported `REPO` would otherwise win and aim every `gh` call at an unvalidated repository, and
an empty `$BASE` yields `--base ""`, which is Locked A's exact failure mode.

**Every value that came out of the repository under review reaches the fence as a FILE you
write, never as text substituted into the fence.** The branch name, the PR title and the PR
body all originate in text produced from the repository under review, and the inputs document
is the only other thing you fill in. **Write all four with the Write tool before you run the
fence**, at exactly these four paths — `<cwd>` is the absolute path Preflight printed as
`SHIP_CWD:`, never a path you infer; the fence recomputes the same four from its own `$PWD` and
refuses outright if the two differ, rather than reading a file it did not expect. **Rewrite all
four every time**: the fence deletes them on every path it reaches, but a run that dies before
it leaves them on disk, and no gate can tell a stale input from a fresh one.

- `<cwd>/.drawbar/tmp/ship/inputs.json` — the inputs document below, filled in.
- `<cwd>/.drawbar/tmp/ship/branch` — the story-lead report's `branch` field, verbatim,
  one line and nothing else.
- `<cwd>/.drawbar/tmp/ship/title` — the PR title, one line and nothing else.
- `<cwd>/.drawbar/tmp/ship/body` — the PR body, verbatim. Its first line is the
  review-provenance line `reviewed at <reviewed_sha> from <spec_source>; N commits since`, with
  both shas already shape-checked and resolved per the prose above. On a flagged story it is
  written out here with its `## Unresolved findings` section already in it, listing each
  surviving finding as `<SUB-ISSUE-ID> — <sub-issue title>` and nothing else: never the finding
  body, never a `file:line`, never a `dedup_key` or any of its fields, never a quoted source
  excerpt.

**The fence authors none of those four files and substitutes nothing into itself.** It carries
no fill-in slot at all: every value it consumes it reads back out of a file it did not write,
with `jq -r`, `cat` or `--body-file`, so no text from the repository under review is ever
parsed by a shell. That is the whole guarantee, and it holds structurally — there is no
instruction here for an agent to follow correctly or to skip.

**The inputs document is a file you write, never a string the fence assembles.** `branch` is
not a key in it: a `"` in a value placed between two `"` inside a hand-assembled JSON document
does not produce invalid JSON that `jq -e .` would refuse — it appends keys, and `jq` resolves
duplicate keys last-wins, so it silently overrides any key declared above it (`arg` names the
state file, `story` picks the base). Both shape gates then pass, because they see only the
laundered values. A key whitelist is not a defence: the injected document has exactly the same
key set. Only values the repository under review cannot author live in here at all.

```json
{
  "arg":     "<the id THIS RUN was invoked with — it names the state file>",
  "story":   "<TEAM>-####",
  "teams":   <the list_teams result for this session, as a JSON array>,
  "flagged": <the report `status`: flagged -> true, ok -> false; a JSON boolean, never a string>
}
```

**The four quoted heredocs this step used to carry are retired, and must never come back.**
They passed the branch, the title, the body and the inputs document through the shell parser.
Quoting neutralised `"`, `$(...)` and backticks — but not a substituted line equal to the
terminator itself, which closed the heredoc and left every line after it parsed as shell:
arbitrary command execution under the operator's authenticated `gh`, with the written file left
looking entirely correct, and the terminators were fixed literals published in this public
repository, so the value an attacker needed was never secret. The interim mitigation was an
instruction above the fence to check each value for such a line and halt; it is deleted here
because it is now inert — there is no terminator left to collide with, and an instruction of
that kind only ever proved it had been written down, never that it was obeyed. Re-adding a
heredoc that carries substituted text reopens the vector in full.

```bash
: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:?CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT must be set}"

# NOTHING in this fence is substituted, and it authors none of the four files it reads. The
# four values that come out of the repository under review — the inputs document, the branch
# name, the PR title, the PR body — were written by the agent with the Write tool before this
# block ran, and this block only ever reads them back with `jq -r`, `cat` and `--body-file`, so
# untrusted text is never parsed by a shell at all. The four QUOTED heredocs that used to carry
# them are gone for good: a substituted line equal to a heredoc terminator closes it early and
# the rest is parsed as shell, and those terminators are fixed literals published in this public
# repository. Do not reintroduce a heredoc, a here-string, or any other fill-in slot here.
# The path is DETERMINISTIC rather than `mktemp -d`, because the agent has to know where to
# write before this block runs; Preflight prints it, so it is never guessed. That gives up
# everything `mktemp -d` provided for free, and each half is bought back explicitly below.
# Unguessability is replaced by the directory gate: this path is entirely predictable, so a
# branch under review can commit `.drawbar/`, `.drawbar/tmp/` or `ship` itself as a DIRECTORY
# SYMLINK (git stores mode 120000 and it survives checkout), and `-L` on the four LEAF paths
# cannot see a symlinked component above them — the agent's writes and this block's `rm -f`
# would both follow it and truncate, then unlink, four arbitrary files under the operator's
# identity. The gate therefore refuses unless $IN_DIR resolves to exactly itself.
# Freshness is replaced only PARTLY, and the limit is stated rather than papered over. The EXIT
# trap removes all four however this block ends, so a run that REACHES it leaves nothing behind;
# but a run that dies before it — session killed, agent errored, story parked in an earlier
# section — leaves all four on disk, and the file gate cannot tell a stale file from a fresh one.
# Rewrite ALL FOUR immediately before running this block. That is the one thing here no gate can
# check for you, and it is why the gate refuses an EMPTY file too: a zero-byte `body` would
# otherwise open a PR with no review provenance and no `## Unresolved findings` section at all.
# What the gate CAN tell is authorship: a branch under review can also just COMMIT four ordinary
# regular files at these names, and they would satisfy every other check on the very first run,
# so a tracked input is refused exactly as a tracked `$CONFIG` is.

echo "PR_OPENED: $PR_URL (base $BASE)"
```

**These three outcomes differ in kind, not merely in degree — the header below names which one
you're in; never file this under one shared "satisfied if any of the following" list.** Each
one has its own prefix in the fence's output, and every refusal carries exactly one of them:
`NO_PR:` is Outcome A, `PR_UNRECORDED:` is Outcome C, `PR_OPENED:` is Outcome B.

**Outcome A — no PR could be opened (halt, distinct from flagged).** A refusal at any of the
three required checks — assert-chain refusing, resolve-base refusing, or `gh pr create`
itself failing — means the chain has no anchor to stack the next story on. This is never the
flagged case: go to *Parking a story*, with `parked_reason` naming which call refused.

**Outcome B — the PR opened.** Record `{story, branch, pr, base, flagged}` in the run state's
`stack` array — `pr` as a JSON number (a positive integer, never the string form) and
`flagged` as a JSON boolean — which is what the fence's `jq --argjson` builds and what its
closing `assert-chain` re-read proves round-trips, then continue to §5.

**Outcome C — the PR opened but the run state does not record it (halt).** Every refusal after
`gh pr create` returns — an unreadable or non-integer PR number, a `FLAGGED` that is not a JSON
literal, an entry that cannot be built, appended, or written, or a round-trip that fails — is
prefixed `PR_UNRECORDED:` and leaves a real pull request open with nothing in the `stack` array
pointing at it. It is not Outcome A: no `NO_PR:` line is printed, because a PR exists. Go to
*Parking a story*, and make `parked_reason` say that the PR is open and unrecorded, with its
URL. **Never re-run this step for that story** — the identical head+base pair is exactly the
422 collision this section's opening paragraph warns about — and never hand-edit the `stack`
array during the run: the repair belongs to the operator's morning review.

## 5. Post the summary comment, leave In Progress

Post a `save_comment` on the story: what shipped, the PR link, the stack position (this
story's place in the run's stack, e.g. "position 3 of the run, based on `<BASE>`"), the
sub-issues filed in §3, and the story-lead's `mutation_pairs`.

**Carry the report's `false_claims` into that comment too, under their own heading**, or say plainly that there were none. Each one is a place the brief asserted something the code contradicts — a defect in drawbar's own research rather than in the diff, and the only signal that ever corrects it. It reaches nobody from inside the report alone: unlike `findings` and `out_of_scope`, nothing files it as a sub-issue, so this comment is where it becomes visible.

**Lead with the correction, and never quote a false claim as a bare statement.** Write each as `what is actually true (file and symbol) — an earlier brief wrongly asserted: "<claim>"`, correction first and the claim clearly subordinate to it. `/drawbar-work` instructs a lead to read this story's comments, so anything posted here is re-read by a later session — a bare quote of a false claim is indistinguishable from a statement of fact by the time it is recalled, which is exactly the failure this whole story exists to stop. The same rule the report contract states: a claim is a signal about our research, not a fact about the code, and it never earns the phrasing of one.

**Leave the story `In Progress`. No status transition of any kind** — never `Done`, `Ready
for QA`, `Ready for Rollout`, `Rolled Out`, or any completed-type status. The operator's own
review and merge is the only thing that ever moves it past `In Progress`; this step never
does.

## 6. Capture and sync knowledge

Inline KB writes made mid-run by the story-lead or implementer (`drawbar-kb add`) are **not**
waited for or batched here — they are already on disk by the time this step runs. This step
commits whatever is on disk (inline writes included) plus the report's own `lessons[]`,
tolerantly retries against a concurrent push, and halts loud on genuine exhaustion rather than
continuing silently (F8: the old loop's `break` fired only on success, so total failure once
printed nothing and execution continued anyway).

```bash
: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:?CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT must be set}"

# --- the trust root, re-derived here (separate Bash invocation from Preflight's — no shell
# --- state survives across tool calls, so $CONFIG must be re-declared, not remembered) -------
#
# $CONFIG is re-resolved from $PWD here, so BOTH of Preflight's guards run again, verbatim —
# MUST-CHECK cross-invocation-guard-applies-per-variable-not-per-fence: the re-declare-AND-assert
# discipline applies to every variable a later fence re-derives, and $CONFIG's assertion IS the
# tracked-config refusal. §6 runs AFTER §4/§5's branch work, so "Preflight already checked" does
# not cover a `.drawbar/ship.config.json` that appears mid-run, and this fence's $PWD need not be
# Preflight's. Dropping the guards lets a branch under review plant a config and feed its own
# `envDir` into `--env-dir` and `git -C`; an equality guard does not help, because both sides then
# agree — on the attacker's directory. (The tracked-config refusal keeps Preflight's
# `&& { ... } || true` shape deliberately: it is the same guard, not a reworded copy of it, and it
# is asked about the symlink-resolved path for the reason Preflight's copy spells out.)
#
# Cross-reference: this fallback duplicates ship-config.ts's `resolveConfigPath` and Preflight's
# own copy of it — keep all three in sync if the default location or the env-var name changes.

# `--config-path` that disagrees.

CONFIG_REAL=$(readlink -f "$CONFIG") || { echo "FATAL: cannot resolve $CONFIG to a real path — refusing."; exit 1; }

# The non-emptiness check above is a typo guard, NOT a security boundary, and this fence no
# longer pretends otherwise. `$RESOLVED` is a prose placeholder THIS MODEL fills in from its own
# context, so `$ENV_DIR` is agent-held mutable state, and it reaches `git -C` inside kb-sync.ts —
# an arbitrary-code-execution sink (git reads the named directory's own repository config, which
# supplies `core.sshCommand` on a pull and a `reference-transaction` hook on a successful push). What
# actually contains that is `--config-path` below: kb-sync.ts parses $CONFIG_REAL with
# ship-config.ts's `parseShipConfig` and REFUSES unless the config's `envDir` equals the
# `--env-dir` it was handed. That equality is only worth anything because the module also pins
# WHICH file may vouch — it must be the one this environment's own $DRAWBAR_SHIP_CONFIG/$PWD
# resolve to, and it must not be tracked by git — so naming a planted config as its own trust root
# no longer works. The guards above are this fence's half of that: they refuse a tracked config
# before it is ever passed, and they are the reason a `--config-path` reaching the module has
# already been checked twice.

```

`kb-sync.ts` owns the whole sequence — stage (both `knowledge.jsonl` and
`knowledge.archive.jsonl`), commit-if-staged, assert a clean precondition, rebase, push,
retry-only-on-a-genuine-rejection, and `reindex` **last**, only after a successful push
(`index.db` is gitignored and derived, and the rebase can bring in entries the local index has
never seen). A non-zero `duplicateKeys` on a successful sync is a benign union-merge artifact
of a concurrent supersede, not a failure — it is reported on stdout and warned on stderr, with
an ATTENDED `drawbar-kb compact` named as the remedy; see the module's own top-of-file comment
for the full reasoning. There is no second, hand-copied bash implementation of any of this here
(single-implementation-site regression discipline).

> **Never run `drawbar-kb archive` or `compact` here.** Both mutate the store with no
> confirmation and no output that reads as destructive; `recall` searches active entries
> only, so archived knowledge vanishes silently. A stray `archive` moved over a thousand
> entries out of reach in one command. `add` / `recall` / `reindex` only.

## 7. Advance

Append the story to `stories_done`. `in_flight` is **not** cleared here — §5 (post the
summary comment) does not clear it either; it is cleared only by *Parking a story* and
*Crash recovery* below. `PushNotification`
one line: story id, PR link, sub-issues filed. `ScheduleWakeup`
for the next story (under `/loop`), or report and finish.

## Parking a story

`status: parked`, a guard refusal, a blocked blocker, or any hard failure: leave the PR
open, leave the story `In Progress`, **clear `in_flight` in the state file** (`in_flight:
null` — Locked 13: a parked story is not an in-progress dispatch), `PushNotification` the
reason, and **`ScheduleWakeup({stop: true})`**.

**Halt — never skip.** Stories are dependency-ordered; building N+1 on a gap produces work
that looks like progress and is not.

## Crash recovery

The most likely overnight failure is not a clean halt — it is a dead session with a state
file present, a dirty tree, a branch mid-story, no PR, and no Linear comment. Preflight
must route here rather than dying. **A stale `in_flight`** (step 2's duplicate-dispatch
guard: `now - in_flight.agent_dispatched_at` exceeding 2x the heartbeat) **routes here too**
— that is Locked 13's whole point: a crashed run must not deadlock every later invocation by
leaving `in_flight` permanently "fresh" from a no-op's point of view.

**Recovery re-establishes the stack base, not merely the in-flight story.** That is the
responsibility this section gained with the stack: a resumed run that resolves the wrong base
opens a pull request whose diff carries another story's work — green, plausible, and
near-impossible to spot in the morning. It is the one crash-resume failure that produces no
error at all, which is exactly why the base is re-established by `stack.ts` and confirmed before
anything is re-dispatched, never inferred from the branch that happens to be checked out.

1. **Read the state file** for the story that was in flight (`in_flight.story`, or — if
   `in_flight` is somehow already null — the last id not in `stories_done`).
2. **Read that story's Linear comments** — step 2's start comment names the branch and time.
3. **Establish where it got to**, in this order: is there an open PR for the branch? a
   pushed branch? local commits? only uncommitted changes? (The repo probe used here is a
   crash-recovery tool ONLY — it has a blind window between dispatch and first commit,
   demonstrated when it read "indistinguishable from never started" one minute after a live
   dispatch. Never use it to gate the fresh-in-window no-op check in step 2.)
4. **Re-establish the base before re-dispatching anything.** One state skips this step: if step
   3 found the PR already open **and** the `stack` array already records this story, the
   PR-opening step completed and only the tail of the run was lost. That state is correct, not
   broken — resolve **no** new base for it, and resume at §5 (post the summary comment).
   `resolve-base` refuses `story_already_stacked` for exactly that state, and that one reason
   means "already stacked", never "park". Every other resume re-establishes the base *here*,
   through the fence below, never from the branch that happens to be checked out and never
   re-derived in bash: `stack.ts assert-chain` confirms every recorded predecessor branch still
   exists and still points where the `stack` array says, then a fresh `stack.ts resolve-base`
   produces the base for this story. Any other refusal from either call **parks the story**:
   refuse rather than guess, because guessing here is what silently re-parents the story onto
   another story's work. Echo each verdict's `.reason` and nothing else — paraphrase, never
   paste, a `detail`.

   **`--project-dir` is a trust root, and this fence is the only sanctioned way to produce one.**
   MUST-CHECK `r3-must-not-source-project-dir-from-pasted-run-state`: the value handed to
   `--project-dir` comes from the fresh `ship-config.ts validate` inside this block and from
   nowhere else — never `jq '.resolved_config' "$STATE"`, and never the `resolved_config` that
   step 1 has already read into context. The state file is agent-writable, so a `--project-dir`
   taken from it turns `stack.ts`'s equality guard into a tautology about whatever directory that
   file names, and hands `git -C` a repository an attacker chose. Recovery is also the worst
   moment to drop the config guards: it runs with a dirty tree and the branch under review checked
   out, which is precisely the tree that can plant a config of its own. Both of Preflight's guards
   therefore run again here, verbatim.

5. **Clean up the dead agent's wreckage before re-dispatching anything.** The crash that
   forced this step left **a branch with zero commits and a 509-line untracked file in the
   tree**. A naive retry runs `git checkout -b <branch>`, dies on *"already exists"*, and the
   recovery path then fails on the wreckage of the first failure instead of recovering from
   it. `stack.ts plan-cleanup` decides what to do; it only ever **reads**, and this step
   executes the plan it names.

   **`salvage_ref_exists` is not a bug — it is the guard working.** It means an earlier crash
   on this same story already preserved work there. Resolve that by hand; never overwrite it.

6. **Resume at the earliest incomplete step.** Step 5 has already returned the tree to a state
   worth resuming from, so re-dispatch the story-lead pointing at that branch and at the base
   step 4 re-established, **re-writing `in_flight`** with the new dispatch time exactly as step
   2 does for a fresh dispatch. On a `salvage_and_reset` or `reset_branch` plan the brief must
   **name the salvage branch** if there is one, so the re-dispatched agent can consult the
   preserved work rather than rediscovering it.
7. If the tree is dirty but the state file names **no** in-flight story, halt and notify —
   that is unexplained, and unexplained state is not something to resolve unattended.
8. If recovery instead determines the story is unrecoverable and must be halted outright,
   **clear `in_flight`** (`in_flight: null`) before halting — same as *Parking a story*.

> Discipline that makes this work: commit each verified increment (the story-lead's §2), and
> post the start comment *before* dispatching. A crashed run once left two hours of work as
> uncommitted files with no record of intent.

## Finishing the run

Snapshot exhausted: run **`/drawbar-learn`** once across the whole run for cross-story
curation, sync the KB as in step 6, `PushNotification` with parent id / PR links / parked,
then `ScheduleWakeup({stop: true})`.

## Hard rules

- Sequential. One story per invocation. Never parallel.
- Halt on failure; never skip a story.
- `--base` comes from `scripts/lib/stack.ts`'s `resolveBase`, invoked as `stack.ts resolve-base`:
  the configured `baseBranch` for the first story of a run, the previous story's recorded branch
  for every story after that (Locked A). Never re-derive it in bash, never read it out of the
  run-state file by hand, and never omit `--base`.
- **Never dispatch story N+1 onto a branch with no commits.** §2's `assert-chain` gate runs
  before every dispatch and refuses `branch_commitless`. That reason is distinct from
  `branch_moved` on purpose: a commitless branch is safe to reset, a moved one never is.
- **The orchestrator performs no git write against a worktree an agent holds.** A plain
  `git push` from the orchestrator once ran the pre-push hook against a worktree an implementer
  was actively editing, and `tsc` failed on a transient mid-edit state — a failure with no cause
  in either party's work. While `in_flight` is non-null, the orchestrator's git access to
  `$PROJECT_DIR` is **read-only**. Crash recovery's cleanup writes only because a stale
  `in_flight` means no agent is live. **Ref manipulation goes through the GitHub API**, which
  touches neither the working tree nor the hooks:

  ```bash
  gh api "repos/$REPO/git/refs" -f ref="refs/heads/$BRANCH" -f sha="$SHA"
  ```
- **Locked F: never merge, never verify a merge, and never inspect whether one happened.** There
  is no merge step, no merge check, and no out-of-order-merge detection or repair anywhere in
  this command, and none is planned. The operator merges, bottom-up and in order.
- A `flagged` story still gets its PR and the stack still continues on top of it; a story with
  **no** PR parks and halts the run, because the chain has no anchor. Never treat the two as
  degrees of the same outcome.
- **Any guard refusal text — `ship-config.ts`, `stack.ts`, `kb-sync.ts` alike — must be
  paraphrased, never pasted**, into `parked_reason`, a Linear comment, or a KB entry. Echo the
  verdict's `.reason` and nothing else: a `detail` carries absolute paths and the real repo slug,
  and this repo is public.
- Never `--no-verify`, never force-push, never commit to `main` directly.
- **Never set `Done` / `Ready For QA` / `Ready for Rollout` / `Rolled Out`** — and never
  grant a subagent Linear authority.
- Never run `drawbar-kb archive` or `compact`.
- Filing out-of-scope findings as sub-issues is mandatory.
- Never accept a story whose `mutation_pairs` are empty.

## Operator notes

- **In the morning: review bottom-up and merge bottom-up, in order.** The run leaves you a stack
  of open pull requests, each based on the one below it and each story left `In Progress`. Only
  the bottom PR's diff is meaningful against the configured base; every PR above it becomes
  meaningful as the one below it lands. Merging out of order leaves later PRs showing a diff
  against a base that has moved.
- **Keeping the stack mergeable is yours, and nothing here checks it.** Per Locked F this command
  never merges, never verifies a merge, and never inspects whether one happened — there is no
  detection or repair of an out-of-order merge, and none is planned. If it happens, the recovery
  is a rebase you do by hand. This is a contract rather than a missing feature, so it is not
  something to file.
- **A `flagged` PR is a PR to review, not a failure.** Its `## Unresolved findings` section names
  each surviving finding by sub-issue id and title; the write-ups are in those Linear sub-issues,
  deliberately not in the public PR body. A story that could not open a PR at all is the other
  case entirely: the run parked and stopped there, so the stack ends at the story below it.
- **A config file must exist before running.** Copy `.drawbar/ship.config.example.json`,
  fill in real `envDir` / `projectDir` / `repo` / `team` / `baseBranch` /
  `requiredChecks` values, and either save it at `<cwd>/.drawbar/ship.config.json` or point
  `DRAWBAR_SHIP_CONFIG` at it. Preflight fails closed on a missing file, and
  `ship-config.ts` fails closed on every one of the four Locked-18 assertions (repo identity,
  `projectDir`/`envDir` separation, team resolution, `baseBranch` being
  the repo default) — a copied-but-unedited example is refused outright (see the
  `scaffolding` describe in `scripts/plugin.test.ts`).
- **The example config's placeholder values are deliberately invalid** — this repo is
  public, so a config that "just works" out of the box would be a one-file opt-in past the
  repo-identity containment the config exists to provide.
- Nothing in this command probes `$PWD` or a parent directory for `.drawbar/memory` or a
  project checkout — `$ENV_DIR`, `$PROJECT_DIR`, `$REPO`, `$BASE_BRANCH` and `$KB` all come
  from the validated config, resolved absolutely, regardless of the directory you run from.
- Code git work targets `$PROJECT_DIR`; the knowledge sync targets `$ENV_DIR`. Separate repos.
- **A real ship config must never be tracked by git** (Important 8, fix pass 2). Preflight
  refuses outright if `$CONFIG` is tracked in its own repository — the config now lives as a
  file inside a working directory rather than exported env vars, and any repository's tree
  (including a contributor PR) can otherwise plant one. Keep it untracked, as `.gitignore`
  already enforces for the default path.
- **§4's four inputs are files, not text pasted into a shell.** The branch name, the PR title,
  the PR body and the inputs document are written with the Write tool under
  `<cwd>/.drawbar/tmp/ship/`, and the fence there only reads them. Preflight creates that
  directory's self-ignoring `.gitignore` in whatever repository you run from, before anything is
  written into it, so a body left behind by a killed run is never stageable by the story-lead's
  `git add -A`. The fence deletes all four files on every exit path it reaches — but that is
  cleanup, not freshness: a run that dies before the fence leaves them on disk, and the fence's
  gate cannot tell a stale input from a fresh one. The agent rewrites all four each time.
- **Any guard refusal text must be paraphrased, never pasted**, into a KB entry or a Linear
  comment — `stack.ts`'s verdicts exactly as much as `ship-config.ts`'s, and a `parked_reason`
  exactly as much as a comment. Refusal `detail` strings echo absolute paths and the real repo
  slug (`assert-chain`'s name a predecessor branch and the `projectDir` it was asked about), and the
  slug leak-scan rule is deliberately out of scope for `knowledge.jsonl` (prose there produces
  too many false-positive "word / word" matches to allowlist) — pasting a refusal verbatim
  would leak it unscanned.
- **Where a crashed agent's partial work goes: `drawbar/salvage/<branch>`, in `$PROJECT_DIR`.**
  When a dispatch dies leaving a commitless branch and a dirty tree, Crash recovery commits
  everything — untracked files included — onto that branch before resetting anything. It is
  never discarded and never force-overwritten: a second crash on the same story refuses
  `salvage_ref_exists` rather than clobbering the first one's work. List them with:

  ```bash
  git -C "$PROJECT_DIR" branch --list 'drawbar/salvage/*'
  ```

  Nothing deletes these; pruning them is the operator's call once the work has been recovered
  or is confirmed worthless.
- Session must survive the night: `caffeinate -is`.
- Permissions must be pre-approved or the loop stalls until morning. Run
  `/fewer-permission-prompts` first.
- Cost: one story measured at ~840k subagent tokens (~270k test authoring, ~127k code
  review, ~115k security review, ~330k fix rounds). A 6–8 story night is several million.
- **Review depth is always full** — both reviewers, every story, no exceptions. This is a
  decision, not an oversight: reviewer cost scales with diff size, so a small story is
  already cheap, and the stories where a downgrade would save real money are exactly the
  large backend/security-touching ones that most need two independent lenses. Do not add a
  depth dial without a measured reason to.
