# drawbar

A lean, Linear-native design → plan → work → learn workflow for Claude Code and Codex, with a per-project compounding knowledge base.

Enjoy a mix of AI generated readme, and my interjections in the text below. 

## Why is it called drawbar
I just got a **[clonewheel](https://www.crumar.it/?a=showproduct&b=39)** and am digging it, a lot. Other than that, no reason. I'm following the grand tradition of software projects with inscrutable names.  

## Who it's for

drawbar is for people who love the **[Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads)** way of working — atomic, traceable issues and knowledge that *compounds* across sessions instead of evaporating — but who:

- **live in Linear.** Your issues stay in Linear, visible to the whole team: a spec is a parent issue's description, stories are ordered sub-issues, status flows `Todo → In Progress → Done`. Issues aren't stored locally. I know this makes things slower and probably wastes tokens, but this works better for my and my team.
- **want a human in the loop, not full autonomy.** drawbar is a set of deliberate, reviewable steps — you sharpen scope, pick the approach, approve the plan, and review the work — rather than a fire-and-forget agent. If beads is meth, this is a glass of iced tea.

This is really just an old-school issue tracking workflow with some glue. It is not novel but it has been working well for me. 

The knowledge base is the heart of it: every lesson, decision, and "MUST-CHECK" you capture is recalled on the next design/plan/work, so the system gets sharper the more you use it.

If you want maximum agent autonomy, drawbar will feel too hands-on. If you want an agent that drafts and proposes while *you* stay the decision-maker — and a memory that actually accumulates — that's the point.

## Requirements

drawbar needs two things set up before it works:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** — runs the `drawbar-kb` knowledge CLI (and the tests). Install: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.
- **The Linear MCP, connected in Claude Code or Codex** — drawbar tracks all work in Linear through the MCP. Without it, the workflows can still run locally but won't write to Linear.

Plus either Claude Code or Codex (the plugin host).

## Install

1. **Add the marketplace and install the plugin:**

   ```bash
   claude plugin marketplace add mjn298/drawbar
   claude plugin install drawbar@drawbar
   ```

   Then run `/reload-plugins` (or restart) so the `/drawbar-*` commands load.

2. **Run `/drawbar-setup` once in a project.** It links the `drawbar-kb` CLI onto your PATH (via `bun link` from the installed plugin), records your Linear team in `.drawbar/config.json`, and initializes the knowledge base.

   If `drawbar-kb` still isn't found afterward, add Bun's global bin to PATH:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$(bun pm bin -g):$PATH"
   ```

### Codex

Codex exposes the same workflows as skills, selected from natural-language requests rather than slash commands:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add mjn298/drawbar
codex plugin add drawbar@drawbar
```

Ask Codex to “set up drawbar for this project.” When it needs to link or invoke bundled scripts, set `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` to the installed plugin directory containing `package.json`; the variable is retained for compatibility with the shared workflow files.

> Hacking on drawbar itself? Skip the marketplace and load the repo directly — see [Development](#development).

## Use

```
/drawbar-setup [legacy knowledge.jsonl]              # once per machine + per project
/drawbar-design <feature | issue-id> [--project P]   # spec → Linear parent issue
/drawbar-plan <issue-id> [--project P]               # ordered story sub-issues
/drawbar-work <issue-id>                             # implement next story, TDD
/drawbar-learn [issue-id]                            # curate lessons into the KB
```

In Codex, ask naturally: “set up drawbar”, “design <feature> with drawbar”, “plan <issue-id> with drawbar”, “work on <issue-id> with drawbar”, “learn from <issue-id> with drawbar”, or “ship <issue-id> with drawbar”.

`issue-id` is a Linear issue identifier (e.g. `ABC-123`) — your team's own prefix.

The `[legacy knowledge.jsonl]` argument to `/drawbar-setup` is **only** for migrating an existing **lavra** knowledge base into drawbar. If you weren't using lavra before — most people — skip it and start with a fresh, empty knowledge base.

## Project config

drawbar hardcodes no Linear team. `/drawbar-setup` writes a repo-local `.drawbar/config.json`; see `.drawbar/config.example.json` for the full shape.

```json
{ "team": "PAS" }
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `team` | **Required in practice.** The Linear team new issues are filed against. Without it, `/drawbar-design` stops and asks rather than guessing. |
| `project` | Optional standing Linear project. Most repos omit it and pass `--project` per invocation, because a project is a unit of work rather than a property of the checkout. |
| `memoryDir` | Optional. Moves the knowledge store off the repo root — see below. |

Environment overrides, for a machine-wide choice no config file records: `DRAWBAR_TEAM`, `DRAWBAR_PROJECT`, `DRAWBAR_MEMORY_DIR`, and `DRAWBAR_CONFIG` (points at a config file elsewhere).

## Where knowledge lives

The store is per **repository**, not per working directory. It resolves in this order — `--dir`, `DRAWBAR_MEMORY_DIR`, `memoryDir` in the config, then `<main worktree root>/.drawbar/memory`.

The default anchors to the **main worktree root** — the parent of the shared `.git` directory — so every linked worktree of the repo reads and writes the same knowledge. This is deliberate: a store resolved from `$PWD` gives each worktree its own empty one, and stories are implemented in worktrees constantly.

Whether the store is committed is your choice. Leave `memoryDir` unset to keep it at `<repo root>/.drawbar/memory`, where the JSONL can be tracked and shared with the team (the SQLite index beside it is gitignored). Set `memoryDir` to a path outside the repo — `~/.drawbar/<repo>` works — to keep it local to your machine.

Ask the CLI rather than assuming:

```bash
drawbar-kb context           # root, config, store, team, project — and where each came from
KB=$(drawbar-kb path)        # just the absolute store path
drawbar-kb recall "dynamodb tenancy" --dir "$KB" --json
drawbar-kb stats --dir "$KB"
```

## Development

Working on drawbar itself? The `kb` tool has tests:

```bash
bun test
```

**Loading your edits — two modes:**

- **Iterating fast → run the live source directly.** Launch Claude Code with `--plugin-dir` so it loads your working copy and bypasses the plugin cache entirely:

  ```bash
  claude --plugin-dir /path/to/drawbar
  ```

  Edits to commands/agents/skills take effect on `/reload-plugins` — no version bump, no reinstall. It shadows any installed copy for that session only.

- **Releasing a change through the marketplace → bump the version.** The plugin cache is **keyed by `plugin.json` version**, so editing files in place at the *same* version silently won't propagate — `/reload-plugins` keeps serving the stale cached copy. To ship a real change:

  ```bash
  # 1. bump "version" in .claude-plugin/plugin.json (e.g. 0.1.1 → 0.1.2)
  claude plugin marketplace update <marketplace>   # re-read the source
  claude plugin update drawbar@<marketplace>        # fetch the new version
  # 2. /reload-plugins (or restart) in your session
  ```

  Forgetting the version bump is the #1 "my change didn't show up" gotcha.

## Credits

drawbar stands on the shoulders of three projects:

- **[Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads)** — the model that started it: atomic, dependency-aware issues and knowledge captured as you work so it compounds across sessions.
- **[linear-beads](https://github.com/nikvdp/linear-beads)** by [@nikvdp](https://github.com/nikvdp) — beads-style issue tracking with Linear as the backend. The inspiration for keeping issues in Linear (human-visible) instead of a local database.
- **[lavra](https://github.com/roberto-mello/lavra)** by [@roberto-mello](https://github.com/roberto-mello) — the design → plan → work → review → learn skill pipeline and knowledge-compounding approach that drawbar's workflow is modeled on.

drawbar is a leaner take that combines lavra's workflow with linear-beads' Linear-first tracking, around its own knowledge base — built for human-in-the-loop work.
